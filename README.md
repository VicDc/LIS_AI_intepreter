# LIS_AI_intepreter - A Bridge for Communication

> ⚠️ **Project Under Development**
>
> This project is currently in an active development phase. The features described are the ultimate goal and may not yet be fully implemented. The architecture and approaches are continuously evolving.

## The Vision

The goal of this project is to create a bridge between the world of Italian Sign Language (LIS) and the world of spoken and written language. We aim to develop an intuitive tool capable of translating signs in real time to break down communication barriers and promote a more inclusive society.

We believe that technology can and should serve people by facilitating interaction in everyday situations: from a dialogue with a shopkeeper, to classroom participation, to emergencies.

## Who It's For

This tool is designed for:

* **Deaf individuals**, to offer an alternative and immediate communication channel in any environment.
* **Professionals** (teachers, healthcare workers, law enforcement) who interact with the deaf community and need a support tool.
* **Family, friends, and colleagues** of deaf individuals, to make communication more fluid.
* **Anyone** interested in approaching LIS and better understanding deaf culture.

## How It Will Work: The Conceptual Flow

The system is designed to follow a logical and transparent process:

1.  **Video Input**: The system captures a video stream from a simple webcam or analyzes a pre-recorded file.
2.  **Sign Recognition**: A visual recognition engine analyzes the images to identify the gestures, expressions, and movements that make up LIS signs.
3.  **Sequence Interpretation**: The recognized signs are ordered into a sequence to understand the communicative context and intent.
4.  **Translation to Italian**: An advanced linguistic component processes the sequence of signs and transforms it into a grammatically correct and coherent Italian sentence, respecting its nuances.
5.  **Output Display**: The final translation is instantly displayed as text on the screen or reproduced through voice synthesis.

## Current Status & Next Steps

The project is live and constantly progressing. Here is an overview of our conceptual progress:

- [x] Defined the project vision and goals.
- [x] Analyzed requirements for an effective user experience.
- [x] Collected and studied source video material for analysis.
- [ ] Developing the first prototype of the visual recognition engine.
- [ ] Implementing a preliminary linguistic translation model.
- [ ] Creating a demonstrative user interface.

## Contributing

As the project is in its early stages, we are not yet seeking active code contributions. However, all forms of feedback, suggestions, or interest are crucial and highly appreciated. If you have ideas or simply want to discuss the project, feel free to open an "Issue" in this repository.
